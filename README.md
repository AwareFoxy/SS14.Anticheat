# SS14.Anticheat/SS14AC
#### or Misandry's Space Station 14 AntiCheat Module

(Unfinished) Event-based anticheat for an otherwise hole-ridden game, entirely content.

### Inclusions
Inclusions are files that will be included in the respective game modules on build.
This is made so you could have all the files relating to the anticheat in one solution folder.

Inclusions are copied using the SetInclusions.py script.
